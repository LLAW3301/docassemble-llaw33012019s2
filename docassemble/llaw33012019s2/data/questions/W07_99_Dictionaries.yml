# Demonstration of how dictionaries work
# Not used in class but useful as a resource
---
# First of all, you must declare your dictionary as an object
objects:
  - MJFids: DADict
---
# Mandatory block displays output
mandatory: True
question: List of FANs and names
subquestion: |
  Here's how to display a specific entry:
  
  - Entry for `ferr0182` is ${ MJFids['ferr0182'] }
  
  Here's how to display all the entries in the dictionary:
  
  FAN|Name
  ---|----
  % for MJFkey in MJFids.keys():
  ${ MJFkey } | ${ MJFids[MJFkey] }
  % endfor
  
  We could just dump the entire dictionary as well:
  
  - The keys are displayed by default: ${ MJFids }
  - You can display the values: ${ MJFids.values() }
buttons:
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart

# Using a code block to populate the dictionary.
# We could use question blocks too.  We'll do that
# in another example
code: |
  MJFids['ferr0182'] = 'Mark Ferraretto'
  MJFids['smit0354'] = 'Benjamin Smith'
  MJFids['alle0973'] = 'Natalie Allen'
  MJFids['alve0235'] = 'Cassandra Alvey'
  MJFids['beit0098'] = 'Joshua Bietzel'
---
# A DADict has special 'methods' that allow you to automate
# asking questions (we will get to these later).  For now, you
# should always include this code block for your DADict
code: |
  MJFids.there_is_another = False
