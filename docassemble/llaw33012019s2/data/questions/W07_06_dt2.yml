# Making decisions using a decision table
---
# First we declare the table as an object
objects:
  - MJFdt: DADict
---
# and then we populate it
# It won't be clear from the table itself what each field is for.  Best practice is
# to describe the fields in these comments ie:
# Field description:
# - Age category
# - Relationship status
# - Living independently
variable name: MJFdt
data:
  # Age category (16_to_17, 18_to_20, 21_to_64)
  16_to_17:
    # Relationship status (single, not_single, ill_health)
    single:
      # Living independently (True or False)
      # For couples this should always be set to True
      False: 954.2   # Set the income threshold here
      True:  1372.6
    couple:  
      True:  2692.8  # Couples always live independently so can put threshold here.
  18_to_20:
    single:
      False: 1056.8
      True:  1372.6
    couple: 
      True:  2692.8
  21_to_64:
    single:
      True:  2024.4
      False: 2024.4  # No false case given so we assume the same as True
    couple:
      True:  3096.4
    illhealth:
      True:  4008.8

# We'll ask all the questions in one block
question: Please answer these questions
fields:
  - What is your age: MJFage_category

# We need to ask living independently separately because 
# We only ask if the user is single
question: Living Independently
subquestion:
  Do you live on your own or with your parents?
field: MJFliving_independently
buttons:
  - I live with my parents: False
  - I live on my own: True

# Below the living independently question we put a code block to set it
# to 'True' if the user is not single.  Docassemble executes non-mandatory
# blocks from the *bottom up*, so this code block will be executed first.
# If this code block doesn't set the variable then Docassemble will ask the
# question above.
#
# Note there is no 'else' clause in this if statement.  That means if the 
# relationship status *is* single, then MJFliving_indpendently will simply
# not be set in this code block.

  if MJFrelationship_status != 'single':

# We can use a very long if statement to sort out the income threshold.  I have
# only provided three examples here
