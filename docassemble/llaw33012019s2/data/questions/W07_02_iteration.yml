# Demonstrating the benefits of iteration
---
# A list to store questions
---
# A list expressed in YAML
variable name: MJFquestions
use objects: True
data:
  - "What is your name?"
  - "What is your age?"
  - "Where do you live?"
  - "How tall are you?"

# Displaying the questions without iteration
mandatory: True
question: Display without iteration
subquestion: | 
  Without iteration we need to list the questions out one by one
  
  - ${ MJFquestions[0] }
  - ${ MJFquestions[1] }
  - ${ MJFquestions[2] }
  - ${ MJFquestions[3] }

  It's inefficient - too much copy and pasting and difficult to modify
buttons:
  - Continue: continue

# Displaying with iteration is better
mandatory: True
question: Display with iteration
subquestion: |
  Look how much less we're writing here!
  
  % for MJFitem in MJFquestions:
  - ${ MJFitem }
  % endfor
  
  We can use the above three lines of code regardless of
  whether we have 5 or 500 items in our list.  This is a
  much more efficient way to store data
buttons:
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart
