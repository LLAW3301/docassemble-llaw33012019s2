# We need to ask living independently separately because 
# We only ask if the user is single
question: Living Independently

  Do you live on your own or with your parents?

# Below the living independently question we put a code block to set it
# to 'True' if the user is not single.  Docassemble executes non-mandatory
# blocks from the *bottom up*, so this code block will be executed first.
# If this code block doesn't set the variable then Docassemble will ask the
# question above.
#
# Note there is no 'else' clause in this if statement.  That means if the 
# relationship status *is* single, then MJFliving_indpendently will simply
# not be set in this code block.

# We can use a very long if statement to sort out the income threshold.  I have
